# London Underground Line Checker
## Background

This app was made using React. I designed it with the aesthetic of the underground in mind, from a mobile-first perspective.<br>

A hosted version of the app can be seen here.

My intitial wireframes can be seen [here](https://www.figma.com/file/YbsUyRm0WzwHOmSRW0C8uj/London-Underground?node-id=0%3A1).

The app handles data served from the [Transport for London Unified API](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/).

I completed this project as part of a tech test, but may continue to work on it. If so these issues are what I would work on:
 - The animations seem to be very slow on mobile, so I would work on fixing this.
 - I would make some dynamic loading spinners, as opposed to the generic text which is currently used to indicate loading. 
  -  I would the look of the landing page, which feels bare at the moment.
